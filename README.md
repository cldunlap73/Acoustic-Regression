# Boiling Acoustic-Regression Models
This repository consists of code for training and testing 6 different boiling acoustic regression models to compare their accuracy. 
The models include: <br>
* Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-Multilayer Perceptron
* FFT- Random Forest Regression
* FFT- Gaussian Process Regression
* Convoultional Neural Network (CNN) - Multilayer Perceptron
* CNN- Random Forest Regression
* CNN- Gaussian Process Regression

Where FFT and CNN are used as feature extractors on the audio clips.
